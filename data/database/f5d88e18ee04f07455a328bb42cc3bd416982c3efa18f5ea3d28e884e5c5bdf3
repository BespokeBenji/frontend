Both are seven-day figures. The films opened on bank holiday Monday last week with the half-term holiday under way. Warcraft’s figure includes £2.17m in previews earned on its first four days, while the Turtles picked up £2.02m over the Monday-to-Thursday period. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CKgLNGfdSM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3CKgLNGfdSM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Apt comparisons for Warcraft are hard to frame, since notable big-screen adaptations of video games have been scant in recent years. Reboot/sequel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/27/hitman-agent-47-review-shoot-em-up-grind-em-down-with-dullness\">Hitman: Agent 47</a> debuted last August with £961,000 including previews of £171,000. As for Out of the Shadows, predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/16/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-review-total-turkey\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> began in October 2014 with £4.79m, including £1.56m in previews. A comparison of the three-day weekend periods reveals that the new film is significantly behind the pace: £1.47m, compared with £3.22m.</p> <h2><strong>T</strong><strong>he real winner: Me Before You</strong></h2> <p>Landing at number three in the chart with £1.79m, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/me-before-you-review-emilia-clarke-sam-claflin-thea-sharrock\">Me Before You</a> in fact outgrossed both Warcraft: The Beginning and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows on the weekend period. The film’s preview takings were a negligible £42,000. The adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ bestseller faced the challenge of a controversy erupting over the film’s storyline: paraplegic accident victim (Sam Claflin) chooses to end his life. While the news stories increased awareness, it’s hard to say how they affected box-office takings. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh993__rOxA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eh993__rOxA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Me Before You enjoyed a happier start than Claflin’s previous chicklit adaptation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/love-rosie-review-lily-collins-claflin-romcom\">Love, Rosie</a>, based on the Cecelia Ahern novel, kicked off with a disappointing £482,000, including £110,000 in previews in 2014. That film was more of a traditional romantic comedy, whereas Me Before You is a tragic romantic drama with comedic elements. The film’s success follows that of teary teen-cancer romance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/fault-in-our-stars-review-john-green\">The Fault in Our Stars</a> (2014), which earned £11.4m at the UK box office.</p> <h2><strong>The half-term performers</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/24/tim-burton-on-alice-through-the-looking-glass-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jgvm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2511427\"            data-video-name=\"Tim Burton on Alice Through the Looking Glass – video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-574323fde4b0e361e755cb7b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/24/tim-burton-on-alice-through-the-looking-glass-video-interview\">Tim Burton on Alice Through the Looking Glass – video interview</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The fact that the Warcraft and Turtles movies played for seven days in the reporting period allows easy comparison with films that were already on release. Over the same period, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/26/alice-through-the-looking-glass-review\">Alice Through the Looking Glass</a> saw its total rise by £4.77m – significantly more than both of the top two films in the chart. Alice now stands at £7m after 10 days, a number that looks rosier than its anaemic £2.23m opening. Still, the film is way behind the pace of its predecessor: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/04/alice-in-wonderland-review\">Alice in Wonderland</a> stood at £22.75m at the same stage of its run.

Still, a screen average above £2,000 in the second week of release is impressive, and the film should hold its venues for a third session. It doesn’t face much competition for the audience that veers away from mainstream films, unless you count Shane Black’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/15/the-nice-guys-review-russell-crowe-and-ryan-gosling-cannes\">The Nice Guys</a> or Jodie Foster’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/money-monster-review-george-clooney-jodie-foster-cannes-2016\">Money Monster</a> – both playing widely in multiplexes. The Nice Guys opened with just over £1m. Black’s Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang (2005) grossed £1.71m over the course of its UK theatrical run.</p> <h2><strong>The flop</strong></h2> <p>At the foot of our Other openers chart is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/misconduct-review-al-pacino-anthony-hopkins\">Misconduct</a>, with a very weedy £97 from five cinemas – that’salmost four people per venue.

bath","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>“My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains my sense.” This is what I thought when I couldn’t sleep on Saturday night and ended up listening to a podcast about the European Union referendum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2016/may/31/is-rushdie-right-about-rote-learning-is-rushdie-right-about-rote-learning\">Is Rushdie right about rote learning? Is Rushdie right about rote learning?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On another occasion, after climbing into a bath without testing the water: “Too hot, too hot!” I screeched, and then, a bit less relevantly, “To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods. I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances; But not for joy; not joy.”</p> <p>I have been <a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/winters_tale/winters_tale.1.2.html\" title=\"\">quoting Leontes</a> in the bath ever since I studied The Winter’s Tale for A-level. I have been <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/44479\" title=\"\">quoting Keats’ Ode to a Nightingale</a> ever since I studied it for O-level. I think of it when I’m fed up. I think of it when I’m tired. I think of it when I’m broken-hearted. And I think of it when I order a nice glass of Rioja, or what Keats would have called “a beaker full of the warm South”.</p> <p>“There are some people I know,” said Salman Rushdie at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/guardian-hay-festival\" title=\"\">Hay literary festival</a> last week, “who are just able to carry around absurd amounts of poetry in their heads.” Memorising poetry, he added, had become a “lost art”.</p> <p>If it really is lost, it’s a shame. It’s a shame not just because random scraps of poetry from childhood can make you giggle in the bath, and because there’s nothing like a Keats ode to turn a minor irritation into a full-blown drama. It’s a shame because poetry really does do powerful things to the brain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A great poem works at many different levels. The more you read it – the more you live with it – the deeper you can go</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Memorising poetry works as a kind of Zumba class for the little grey cells. Learning poems takes focus. You know, that thing you used to have – before email, Twitter and Facebook photos of your friend’s dogs chewed up what was left of your brain.</p> <p>But to argue that learning poetry is good for your brain is a bit like saying “clean eating” is good for your body (eating, that is, without most of the ingredients most of us would call food, and certainly without most of the joy).</p> <p>It reminds me of the forms I used to have to fill in for the <a href=\"http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Arts Council</a> when I was running the <a href=\"http://poetrysociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Poetry Society</a>. Poetry, I was meant to argue, would improve young people’s communication skills and their ability to get jobs. I wanted the funding, so I did; but what I really wanted to yell was: “Have you ever <em>met</em> a poet?” I’ve met some of the greatest poets of the 20th century, but I can’t say that “employable” was the first word that popped into my head.</p> <p>Poetry is not Ryvita. It is, as the late, great <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/seamus-heaney\" title=\"\">Seamus Heaney</a> suggested, more like electricity. In his <a href=\"http://www.blueridgejournal.com/poems/sh-elect.htm\" title=\"\">poem Electric Light</a> he remembers the “candle-grease congealed, dark-streaked with wick-soot” gloom of the first house he saw that had electric light and how, as a small child, if he “stood on the low-backed chair”, he could just reach the switch. He started writing poetry after hearing <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/gerard-manley-hopkins\" title=\"\">Gerard Manley Hopkins</a> read aloud. “It was,” said Heaney, “the voltage of the language”.</p> <p>Yes, it’s the voltage of the language, the voltage that turned poems in the Soviet Union into a precious cargo that had to be smuggled, or hidden, or scratched on soap. It was the voltage that had poets imprisoned or executed under Stalin, the voltage that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/books/03poets.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">filled football stadiums in Russia</a> in the 1950s, for readings of poems that used metaphors and symbols to say what couldn’t otherwise be said.</p> <p>It’s the voltage I saw in Iran a few years ago, at the tomb of the great 14th-century Persian poet <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/hafez\" title=\"\">Hafez</a>. Men in black suits and women in black chadors wept as they recited <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/pdh/pdh16.htm\" title=\"\">words about a nightingale and a rose</a>.</p> <p>Writing poetry is hard. Even the greatest poets often worry that they will never write another good poem. And reading poetry isn’t easy either. A great poem works at many different levels. The more you read it – the more you live with it – the deeper you can go.</p> <p>Poetry is the opposite of instant. In a sea of information, poetry is an anchor. It can help you stop the world and tap into words and images and rhythms that pulse in your blood and heart and veins: words and images and rhythms that have become a part of you.</p> <p>Poetry is there for your numb heart and your hot bath. It’s there for your hopes. It’s there for your fears. It can, for example, make sure that when you hear Boris Johnson talking about Brexit, what leaps into your head, in a way that makes your heart dance, but “not for joy”, is the famous stage direction from The Winter’s Tale: “Exit, pursued by a bear”.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4kj9q","wordcount":"813","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/56e4e20bc9c1bff072fa8fdd82c587d48e5a1c06/0_396_4326_2596/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-06-10T14:50:22Z","standfirst":"Learn

A Russian would not want them as a gift.” </p> <p>The Russian <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/uk/345373-turgenev-poster-russians-quote-penguin/\">news site RT.com</a> said the quote is spoken by the “outspoken nihilist” Yevgeny Bazarov, while Fathers and Sons publisher Melville House describes it as an “obscure” line, reflecting “the opinion of a single character, one of the narrator’s sons who belongs to <a href=\"http://pistolsdrawn.org/a-history-of-russian-nihilism/\">the ‘nihilist’ movement</a>, which by the 1860s had Russia’s radical youth in an uproar”. </p> <p>“In that context, it powerfully expresses the feelings of a social movement that was sweeping Russia at the time it was written. But here, critics have found that context so glaringly absent that the ad seems to reflect a desire to benefit from – or worse, incite – anti-Russian sentiment in the UK,” <a href=\"http://www.mhpbooks.com/context-nuance-sensitivity-useless-words-an-ad-campaign-doesnt-need-them/\">Chad Felix of Melville House wrote on the publisher’s blog</a>.</p> <p>RT reported that Solovyeva’s post has been shared “hundreds of times”, with some commenters proposing “a thought experiment where a similar quote would substitute Russians for ‘Muslims’ – and wonder[ing] whether that ad campaign would still be allowed”. Others suggested “filing a complaint with UK regulators”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/31/isokon-building-hampstead-pocket-penguins-david-burke\">What Penguins, donkeys and moles have in common</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Penguin Random House has intentionally cited the quote to take a true meaning out of context and have intentionally chosen NOT to include the author and the name of the book on their poster,” says the petition, which has been signed by more than 1,400 people, and which calls for the posters to be removed.<br /></p> <p>A Penguin spokesman said: “The Pocket Penguins series features 20 great works of literature which we believe are true classics and should be read the world over. Alongside Turgenev, there are books by Tolstoy, Gorky, Bulgakov, and it is testimony to the quality of Russian writers that they make up such a large proportion of the series. Our poster campaign is designed to intrigue people to find out more and introduce them to books we believe they will treasure. The campaign is intended as a celebration of these wonderful books.”</p> <p>She added that the poster campaign was scheduled to run for two weeks from 23 May to mark the launch of a new series of Pocket Penguins, and should no longer be on display.</p> <p>Not every Russian seeing the poster has taken offence. <a href=\"http://echomsk.radio.net/\">Echo of Moscow</a> foreign correspondent Tonia Samsonova, who posted a photograph of the poster on social media to a huge response, said: “I didn’t expect such a reaction, but Russian state media are doing a big news story on it now.</p> <p>“Whether you support Putin or not doesn’t matter – the response I have had shows people are not divided by their political views on this.

dementia","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I hadn’t expected a group of women in their 70s in a library to be so boisterous. Nora has recited a ribald verse about a well-known current politician, with bright-eyed relish, while Jill offers wry self-mockery at her continuing failure to finish War and Peace. Barbara is happy to share her passion for reading with kindred spirits. “You lose yourself in a book,” she says, explaining how literature has helped her through hard times in old age.</p> <p>We are sitting in a bright space at Mayflower Court residential care home in Southampton, where one long wall of the modern building is covered in bookshelves containing a diverse selection of titles. They are catering for a clientele who clearly enjoy contemporary biographies and thoughtful non-fiction as well as novels – historical yarns being a particular favourite. The well-read women also draw me into a lively discussion of subjects ranging from ancient history to contemporary sexual politics, alongside literature.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Almost 90% reported uplifted mood, better concentration and better long- and short-term memory</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A growing number of care homes are discovering that libraries and reading groups can transform the lives of their residents, including those with dementia. Residents at Mayflower Court can join the reading group which meets every Tuesday morning in the library.</p> <p>Former librarian and resident, Pat Marton, runs the reading group. “Reading is a fantastic way to encourage the group to keep mentally active and engaged,” she says.</p> <p>It is a view shared by Nicola Toomer, a manager at the home. “The library is a fantastic communal area, which is well used. Reading encourages residents to use their imagination and also provides a point of discussion – something retirees can feel they have lost,” she says.</p> <p>Anchor Housing, which runs Mayflower Court, and is England’s largest not-for-profit provider of housing and care for older people, has been promoting reading groups for its residents for more than a decade.</p> <p>Research published by the centre for research into reading, literature and society (Crils) at the University of Liverpool has found that while any reading helps sharpen the minds of older people, shared reading in groups offers particular benefits. <a href=\"https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/psychology-health-and-society/staff/phil-davis/publications/\" title=\"\">Almost 90% of participants reported uplifted mood, better concentration and better long- and short-term memory.</a></p> <p>Other benefits include reduced levels of agitation, while older people’s sense of connectedness to a wider community was also improved by taking part in reading groups. Participants said they gain insights into their own identity, as well as the world view of others. “Isn’t it funny? We come in with nothing and go out with all these thoughts,” says one reading-group member living with dementia, who took part in the research.According to further studies commissioned by NHS North West, poetry seems particularly beneficial. Its <a href=\"http://www.thereader.org.uk/media/114285/Read_to_Care_new_online.pdf\" title=\"\">2014 report, Read to Care</a>, focused on poetry for reading groups – particularly for people living with dementia. It found that poetry engaged emotions and triggered memory, while the compressed and intense language offered an immediacy and impact different to prose. As part of the reseach, participants – even with those with severe dementia – were prompted to recall poetry learned by heart at school.</p> <p>Philip Davis, professor of literature at Liverpool University is director of Crils and a director of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/oct/19/guardiansocietysupplement4\" title=\"\">award-winning Liverpool-based charity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thereader.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Reader</a>, which aims to connect people through shared reading and to establish it as a <a href=\"http://www.thereader.org.uk/what-we-do-and-why/older-people-dementia.aspx\" title=\"\">non-medical intervention for people with a diagnosis of dementia</a>. He sees the active nature of shared reading in groups as different to <a href=\"http://www.alzheimers.net/2014-04-22/reminiscence-therapy-improves-alzheimers/\" title=\"\">reminiscence therapy</a>, which takes older people back in their minds using objects from the past.</p> <p>“It is a more dynamic awakening – the thoughts seem fresh,” he says. “People find them coming to mind in relation to new things they have never read before.”</p> <p>It isn’t just the elderly readers who benefit. The Reader has found care home staff reporting that residents require less medication after reading groups because they are happier and more relaxed. Reading groups also give staff a way to get to know residents better, gaining insights into their lives and interests.</p> <p>Others gain too. Families are brought closer together through the common denominator of literature, even where dementia has previously created a gulf. Relatives report lear ning new things about their family member or friend through talking about what they have read.</p> <p>And children’s books are provided in many care home libraries as a way to build – or rebuild - a bond across the generations. The residents at Mayflower Court confirm that they take one of the children’s titles from the shelves to read to their grandchildren when they visit.</p> <p>The Reader has published a number of anthologies of prose and poetry for reading aloud to someone you care for. On the publication of its first anthology, called <a href=\"http://www.thereader.org.uk/shop/anthologies/a-little%2c-aloud/c-23/c-67/p-105.aspx\" title=\"\">A Little, Aloud</a>, staff member Katie Clark recounted a visit to a home where she was warned not to approach one aggressive resident. Clark, however, sat down and read her a poem. She recalls: “She relaxed back in her chair, went very quiet, and at the end said, straight away, ‘read another’.”</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4kgz6","wordcount":"831","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/56989c3dd94367979078349de8643b82c60ba71c/0_0_4000_2400/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-06-15T16:22:00Z","standfirst":"Shared reading in groups reduces isolation and can transform the lives even of residents with dementia"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/07/care-home-residents-dementia-life-changing-power-of-library","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2016/jun/07/care-home-residents-dementia-life-changing-power-of-library","sectionName":"Society","section":{"id":"society","webTitle":"Society","editions":[{"id":"society","webTitle":"Society","code":"default","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society"}],"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society"},"elements":[{"id":"56989c3dd94367979078349de8643b82c60ba71c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/56989c3dd94367979078349de8643b82c60ba71c/0_0_4000_2400/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/56989c3dd94367979078349de8643b82c60ba71c","altText":"Nora, Jill and Barbara at their reading group at Mayflower Court residential care home.

After a lifetime of homeschooling, funds have run out and they must go to a normal school with other children. Even when they have the most important decision in their lives lying ahead, Grace and Tippi embrace the situation and live their lives, together.<br /></p> <p>As a huge fan of Sarah Crossan, I was excited to see that this novel had been written in verse like her debut novel, The Weight of Water. I found the story of Grace and Tippi inspiring and thought provoking, as they remain happy throughout their difficult situation. I expected this book to be quite sad and give a predominantly negative outlook of the time the twins spend in school, but it is awe-inspiring and uplifting in a way that only a beautifully written book can achieve. I love the fact that they make friends with Jon and Yasmeen at school and the positive view of the time that the quartet had together gave me the feeling not dissimilar to a great hug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6015bcfd3a644d16b5ca05d781bb9c91fe6f14f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6015bcfd3a644d16b5ca05d781bb9c91fe6f14f1/0_0_700_1070/654.jpg\" alt=\"one sarah crossan\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This book only took me a day or so to read but it is definitely one that will stay with me for a long time and it taught me that I really don’t have anything to complain about.

I love falling into the words and worlds of “my” protagonists, immersing myself into their lives and thoughts. I become a hermit and disappear for while, but there always comes a point when my restlessness takes over and I have to get out, I need to see and feel the “real” world.</p> <p>So researching and writing a book about an intrepid explorer who likened his own adventurous drive to being chased by “10,000 pigs” was the perfect combination. Writing about Alexander von Humboldt in The Invention of Nature was a journey through thousands of letters and books, but also through spectacular landscapes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/13/the-invention-of-nature-the-adventures-of-alexander-von-humboldt-andrea-wulf-review\">The Invention of Nature: The Adventures of Alexander von Humboldt, the Lost Hero of Science by Andrea Wulf – review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Humboldt was the most famous scientist of his age and a daring adventurer. In 1799, he went on a five-year exploration of Latin America, returning to Europe with a new concept of nature that still shapes our thinking. He came up with the idea that nature is a web of life and that earth is a living organism. He even predicted harmful human–induced climate change and warned about the devastating environmental effects of monoculture, irrigation, deforestation and industrial pollution.</p> <p>Having read his letters and diaries, I was determined to travel to the Andes, where he had spent several months, and to the Orinoco where he had been stunned by the rich life in the rainforest. I was lucky, because in 2013 I was the Eccles British Library writer-in-residence, a generous award that allowed me to follow Humboldt’s footsteps through South America. It was as exhilarating as it was hard. At the Orinoco in Venezuela, I encountered (too many) tarantulas, but I also observed river dolphins and listened to the bellowing cries of howler monkeys at night. In the Andes, I was trying to experience what Humboldt must have felt but there was absolutely no way that I was going to hang over a precarious small ledge on Pichincha to stare in the crater of the volcano as he had done. At 13,000 feet on Antisana volcano in Ecuador, I was thrilled to find the hut in which Humboldt had spent a miserable night in 1802. At that very moment, a herd of wild horses surrounded me and four majestic condors circled above – a pretty good day’s research! </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2389f3285099215511de3ccbfd227bc131006f2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2389f3285099215511de3ccbfd227bc131006f2e/0_154_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Wulf on top of Antisana volcano in Ecuador\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Wulf on top of Antisana volcano in Ecuador.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia-Niharika Sen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the most exciting moment for me was climbing Chimborazo, a mountain that had been foundational in Humboldt’s vision of nature. I made it only to 16,400ft – it rises to more than 20,000 – but my admiration for his endurance and achievements grew with every heavy step. The clouds rolled in below me, but I was bathed in sunshine. It felt like standing on the top of the world (and somehow next to Humboldt). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"223c79ed2e89bfd3397f81be923d20975569ed76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/223c79ed2e89bfd3397f81be923d20975569ed76/0_134_3872_2324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) swimming under blue water.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) swimming under blue water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In many ways, The Invention of Nature continues to be a journey. For the past few years, whenever I told people that I was writing a book about Alexander von Humboldt, the most common response was a blank face. Today, he’s almost forgotten in the English–speaking world, but his name lingers everywhere – from the ocean current that hugs the west coast of South America to a penguin, dozens of mountains, plants, rivers and a glacier in Greenland. There are more places, plants and animals named after him than anyone else.</p> <p>I’m determined to restore Humboldt to the pedestal in the temple of nature and science where he rightfully belongs. He’s the founding father of environmentalism and his approach to the natural world is still immensely relevant. He was an interdisciplinary scientist who brought the arts and sciences together. </p> <p>Humboldt believed that we can only understand nature by using our imagination. He was driven by a sense of wonder for nature that I believe is missing in today’s political debates about climate change. When I give talks or interviews, I don’t feel that I’m promoting my book, but that I’m doing publicity for him.</p> <p>When the book was published last year, I was worried that no one would buy a biography about a man they had never heard of – but they did. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/04/kate-atkinson-wins-costa-novel-prize-for-a-god-in-ruins\">It even won the Costa biography prize</a>. I just returned from a 34–talk US book tour and every single time I go on stage to talk about Humboldt, I’m excited to see how people respond to him. Young readers, environmentalists, conservationists or people who are usually not interested in history tell me how amazed they are about this man. That is a part of my journey that makes my heart skip every day.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They were crawling on hands and knees along a high narrow ridge that was in places only two inches wide. The path, if you could call it that, was layered with sand and loose stones that shifted whenever touched. Down to the left was a steep cliff encrusted with ice that glinted when the sun broke through the thick clouds. The view to the right, with a 1,000-foot drop, wasn’t much better. Here the dark, almost perpendicular walls were covered with rocks that protruded like knife blades.</p> <p>Alexander von Humboldt and his three companions moved in single file, slowly inching forward. Without proper equipment or appropriate clothes, this was a dangerous climb. The icy wind had numbed their hands and feet, melted snow had soaked their thin shoes and ice crys­tals clung to their hair and beards. At 17,000 feet above sea level, they struggled to breathe in the thin air. As they proceeded, the jagged rocks shredded the soles of their shoes, and their feet began to bleed.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More about the book</h2> <p>Wulf imbues Humboldt’s adventures there with something of the spirit of Tintin, relishing the jungles, mountians and dangerous animals at every turn … [She] has an unfailing ability to spot an interesting quotation or a curious situation. She is very good on the cities where Humboldt lived and the rival atmospheres of Paris and Berlin … a superior celebration of an adorable figure. - <strong>Simon Winder</strong></p> <p><a

He’s a Conjuror, a descendant of an ancient African bloodline that can change reality with music. Seventeen-year-old twins Matt and Em Calder are the most powerful of their kind. They are Animare, descendants of an ancient order of artists whose imaginations can bring art to life and travel through paintings. Malevolent forces that only a Conjuror can stop are rising in the world.

The main character, Rémy, is a black teenage boy who discovers he is a descendant of a Conjuror — someone who can alter reality with music. I must admit when I first picked up the book I thought Rémy would be as clichéd as clichés could get. The authors definitely prove me wrong. Rémy is three dimensional, very relatable and most importantly his skin colour doesn’t feel like it’s just included to tick the ‘diverse characters box’.</p> <p>Another notable mention is Caravaggio, who may only be a minor character but that didn’t stop the authors from developing him. He is like the Magnus Bane of the Barrowmans’ world with a hint of homage to John’s humorous and crazy role of Captain Jack from Doctor Who. I also really appreciate the other subtle references to the TV series like, ‘wibbly wobbly time’. <br /></p> <p>Similarly to Doctor Who, I love how well researched Conjuror feels in terms of history, especially the slave trade. The setting and voice dramatically changes throughout the different periods of time, which contribute to a better image of the different events and adds to this overall knowledgeable voice of the book. Despite being fantasy, the Barrowmans try very hard to make it as realistic as possible which I quite enjoyed.</p> <p>Additionally, dialogue within fiction is not something all authors get right. The Barrowman siblings’ sparse use of dialect is just enough to create the historical or modern context, when needed and little enough to not get annoying unlike David Almond’s excessive use of ‘mebbe’. </p> <p>Finally, the plot is great and it is only at the end that I realised how cleverly set and structured the plot is and how it joins together like a puzzle. Conjuror’s plot left me returning to the first few pages while reading the final few chapters to reflect the plot’s careful words and clever devices. It was rather like reading crime fiction and the overlapping of genres also works very well in this novel. </p> <p>Conjuror also has its bad sides and at the start I couldn’t find how any puzzle pieces fit the plot. Nothing seems to make much sense and I was left with this overwhelming feeling that I must have (stupidly) missed something. It wasn’t my fault and I understand that now; the structure is meant to be like this to aid the plot. But John and Carole Barrowman could have made this clearer. They rely too much on the assumption that we, the reader, have nothing better to do but trawl through the jigsaw puzzle. There were random changes in points of view, sudden time travel and some awful pacing. I know some people would have left the novel as soon as it was apparent nothing makes sense a quarter way through. </p> <p>Perhaps this flaw is the fault of another pair of very important characters, the Orion twins. Emma and Matt have the cutest relationship in the book, with a fair bit of hate (and love) on each part. These characters come from another book called Hollow Earth. I have nothing against the characters, but rather their existence in this book. After having featured elsewhere, these characters’ appearance means that to someone who hasn’t read Hollow Earth, their story gets confusing. It often feels as though the authors are relying on the reader having previously read Hollow Earth and don’t explain things involving Emma and Matt as well as they could have done. This and the fact that they play a huge part in the second half of the novel, contributes to Conjuror’s fault in structure and desire to confuse the reader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conjuror by John and Carole E. Barrowman may have its faults but overall this is overshadowed by the fact that by the end it was a very enjoyable read. As long as you don’t mind waiting to understand the story, I would recommend the novel to any young adults and adults in search of fantasy, with art and music influences, and for someone who is looking for a fast-paced everyday read.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/390387/\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>RainyWriter: </strong>‘In Three Words: Clever, fast, interesting’","headline":"Conjuror by John and Carol E.

There were a few reasons for this. Firstly, as much as she’s probably the most moral character in the book, she’s still not exactly what people would define as “good.” She may have wanted to let Rupert P go, but she didn’t really put much effort into doing that. And by the end of this story she’s still a little bit of a coward. She’s willing to confess her sins and name names, but she still will not tell you her own name because she does not want to implicate herself in this crime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/oct/26/top-10-songs-in-teen-novels-ultimate-young-adult-playlist\">Top 10 songs in teen novels: the ultimate young adult playlist</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Another reason we don’t find out her name is because she’s writing this whole story down on the internet as a sort of tumblr post, so she’s protected by the anonymity of the internet, as so many fans are. The anonymity gives her the freedom to tell us all the real, ugly details that happened.</p> <p> And finally, not giving her a name is just one more way to make the character a cipher for readers. She’s someone whose shoes they can walk in, and relate with. </p> <p> <strong>What kind of research into fandom and fangirls did you do? Particularly that extreme, utterly dedicated level of fandom.</strong></p> <p> I read a lot about what girls were doing in order to see their favourite bands. Because it’s one thing to listen to their music and quite another to try and meet them. A lot of the things I read about ended up in the book, and actually, in doing this research, a lot of the unfortunately nasty thing these boy bands do to their fans ended up in the book as well. But most of the research was primary. I was a dedicated fangirl in my teen years.

My mission was to write a dark comedy. It was only after I realised that boy band fangirls were the perfect fit for this kind of story that the idea for Kill the Boyband really took off. I recognised these girls as my own people, so I knew I could tell their story with honesty and respect. And humour… and darkness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/sep/02/dark-childrens-books-censorship-rebecca-westcott-discussion\">How dark is too dark in children's books?</a> </p> </aside>  <p> <strong>I got a real Ryan Murphy (creator of Scream Queens) vibe from Kill the Boy Band especially in its humour - where did you get the inspiration for the quite dark, twisted jokes?</strong></p> <p> Thanks so much, I take that as a huge compliment. If I may be so bold, I think that both Murphy and I may get our dark comedy inspiration from the same source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathers\">Heathers</a>. The 1989 movie is (in my opinion) the best example of American black humor, let alone the best example of black humour involving teenagers. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_Queens_(2015_TV_series)\">Scream Queens</a> took a lot of cues from Heather<em>s</em> (<a href=\"http://scream-queens.wikia.com/wiki/The_Chanels\">the Chanels</a>’ names, their pastel-colored clothes). That show was right up my alley.</p> <p> <strong>Did anything major - like the identity of a certain important individual in the second half of the book - change around while you were writing or was it all set in stone from the off?</strong></p> <p> <em>Everything</em> changed around. For me, it takes a few drafts before the characters come to life and begin to distinguish themselves. A couple of characters didn’t even join the story until a few drafts in. I think it’s only after you get to know the characters better that you begin to understand how the story should unfold, not the other way around. Characters dictate plot. Once I have a character down then I know where the story’s going.</p> <p> <strong>What’s next after Kill the Boy Band? Are you writing another YA book?</strong></p> <p> I am indeed.

She puts her half-eaten veggie burger down on its paper plate. Hodges has already demolished his, talking between bites. He doesn’t mention waking with pain; in this version he discovered the message because he got up to net-surf when he couldn’t sleep. </p> <p>‘That’s what it said, all right.’ </p> <p>‘From Z-Boy.’ </p> <p>‘Yeah. Sounds like some superhero’s sidekick, doesn’t it? “Follow the adventures of Z-Man and Z-Boy, as they keep the streets of Gotham City safe from crime!”’ </p> <p>‘That’s Batman and Robin. They’re the ones who patrol Gotham City.’ </p> <p>‘I know that, I was reading Batman comics before you were born. I was just saying.’</p> <p> She picks up her veggie burger, extracts a shred of lettuce, puts it down again. ‘When is the last time you visited Brady Hartsfield?’ </p> <p>Right to the heart of the matter, Hodges thinks admiringly. That’s my Holly. </p> <p>‘I went to see him just after the business with the Saubers family, and once more later on. Midsummer, that would have been. Then you and Jerome cornered me and said I had to stop. So I did.’ </p> <p>‘We did it for your own good.’ </p> <p>‘I know that, Holly. Now eat your sandwich.’ </p> <p>She takes a bite, dabs mayo from the corner of her mouth, and asks him how Hartsfield seemed on his last visit. </p> <p>‘The same … mostly. Just sitting there, looking out at the parking garage. I talk, I ask him questions, he says nothing. He gives Academy Award brain damage, no doubt about that. But there have been stories about him. That he has some kind of mind-power. That he can turn the water on and off in his bathroom, and does it sometimes to scare the staff. I’d call it bullshit, but when Becky Helmington was the head nurse, she said she’d actually seen stuff on a couple of occasions – rattling blinds, the TV going on by itself, the bottles on his IV stand swinging back and forth. And she’s what I’d call a credible witness. I know it’s hard to believe—’ </p> <p>‘Not so hard. Telekinesis, sometimes called psychokinesis, is a documented phenomenon. You never saw anything like that yourself during any of your visits?’ </p> <p>‘Well … ’ He pauses, remembering. ‘Something did happen on my second-to-last visit. There was a picture on the table beside his bed – him and his mother with their arms around each other and their cheeks pressed together. On vacation somewhere. There was a bigger version in the house on Elm Street. You probably remember it.’</p> <p> ‘Of course I do. I remember everything we saw in that house, including some of the cheesecake photos of her he had on his computer.’ She crosses her arms over her small bosom and makes a moue of distaste. ‘That was a very unnatural relationship.’</p> <p> ‘Tell me about it. I don’t know if he ever actually had sex with her—’ </p> <p>‘Oough!’ </p> <p>‘—but I think he probably wanted to, and at the very least she enabled his fantasies. Anyway, I grabbed the picture and talked some smack about her, trying to get a rise out of him, trying to get him to respond. Because he’s in there, Holly, and I mean all present and accounted for. I was sure of it then and I’m sure of it now. He just sits there, but inside he’s the same human wasp that killed those people at City Center and tried to kill a whole lot more at Mingo Auditorium.’ </p> <p>‘And he used Debbie’s Blue Umbrella to talk with you, don’t forget that.’ </p> <p>‘After last night I’m not likely to.’ </p> <p>‘Tell me the rest of what happened that time.’ </p> <p>‘For just a second he stopped looking out his window at the parking garage across the way. His eyes … they rolled in their sockets, and he looked at me. Every hair on the nape of my neck stood up at attention, and the air felt … I don’t know … electric.’ He forces himself to say the rest. It’s like pushing a big rock up a steep hill. ‘I arrested some bad doers when I was on the cops, some very bad doers – one was a mother who killed her three-year-old for insurance that didn’t amount to a hill of beans – but I never felt the presence of evil in any of them once they were caught. It’s like evil’s some kind of vulture that flies away once these mokes are locked up. But I felt it that day, Holly. I really did. I felt it in Brady Hartsfield.’ </p> <p>‘I believe you,’ she says in a voice so small it’s barely a whisper.</p> <ul> <li>From End of Watch. Copyright ©2016 by Stephen King.

Let’s read!","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>The Master and Margarita is this month’s Reading group choice. It was nominated by commenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jun/01/help-choose-a-translated-book-for-junes-reading-group#comment-75475734\">Saorsa</a> and seconded by several others, one of whom called it “one of the best novels ever written”.</p> <p> Certainly, it’s a book that has stood the test of time. In fact, as luck has it, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the first attempt to bring it to publication, following a tortuous gestation.</p> <p>Mikhail Bulgakov started writing The Master and Margarita around 1928 and it quickly became his chief obsession. But he burned his first draft in 1930, thinking he had no future as a writer living in Stalinist Russia. This was a reasonable assumption, for a well-known public figure who refused to toe the party line and had even privately admitted: “My sympathies were entirely on the side of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_movement\">the Whites</a>, whose retreat filled me with horror and incomprehension.”</p> <p> Miraculously, Uncle Joe seems to have liked the irreverent author and spared him. It was an inherited kidney disease that took Bulgakov when he was only 49, in 1940. By this time he had almost finished his masterpiece.

The term didn’t just pop up and go viral. The <a href=\"http://www.nswp.org/\">Global Network of Sex Work Projects</a> (NSWP), an organisation that openly campaigns for brothel-keeping and pimping to be recognised as legitimate jobs, credits itself as largely responsible for “sex work” replacing “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/prostitution\">prostitution</a>” as the go-to terminology for institutions such as <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/\">the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS)</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO).</p> <p>“More than mere political correctness,” the NSWP proudly states, “this shift in language had the important effect of moving global understandings of sex work toward a labour framework.” The fact that prostitution involves sexual acts and some kind of payment is a given. However, engaging with it first and foremost as a labour issue, using the term “sex work” as if it was an adequate and appropriate shorthand for what takes place in strip clubs, on porn sets and in brothels, serves a deeply political goal. Not only does this framework shrink the field of analysis to the seller (to the exclusion of men’s demand and its social impact), it hides what should be front and centre of our response to the transaction: the inherent sexual abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-criminal-policy-sex-money-and-the-long-arm-of-the-law\">The Guardian view on criminal policy: sex, money and the long arm of the law | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The notion that being paid to perform sex acts should be recognised as a kind of service work is the rationale underpinning legalised prostitution regimes. It’s an idea that has managed to unite an eclectic mix of left and rightwing voices. <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/author/peter-frase/\">Peter Fras</a>e – a member of the editorial board of <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/\">Jacobin, a magazine billed as a leading voice of the American left</a> – is in favour of “legalising all forms of sex work for adults”. He claims: “Not only does sex work destabilise the work ideology, it also conflicts with a bourgeois ideal of private, monogamous sexuality.” Tim Worstall, writing for British rightwing thinktank the <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/\">Adam Smith Institute</a>, shares Frase’s policy conclusion, though his reasoning contrasts somewhat. As a type of commercial activity, <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/liberty-justice/why-prostitution-should-be-safe-legal-and-well-not-rare-actually\">Worstall insists the prostitution trade is “obviously free market”</a> and that “renting out body parts is and should be no different from lending them out for fun or for free”.</p> <p>The whole point of the sex industry is that it offers men the chance to buy sexual access to women who do not want to have sex with them – otherwise they wouldn’t have to pay. Masking its fundamental purpose thus becomes the primary PR challenge for the prostitution, pornography and strip club trades if they are to survive – maybe even thrive – in a society that has decided, at least in principle, that women are not subordinate sex objects and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/rape\">rape</a> is a bad thing.</p> <p>Perhaps the single most effective strategy hit upon so far is to pump out the myth contained in the term “sex work”: the myth that it is possible to commodify consent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2016/mar/04/jeremy-corbyn-sex-trade-left-women-exploitation\">Jeremy Corbyn’s views on the sex trade sum up the male left’s betrayal of women | Julie Bindel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How can sexual consent be a thing that can be bought and sold, yet we can still talk with a straight face about there being such concepts as healthy sexual relationships and meaningful consent? If, while having sex with someone, you feel repulsed by them touching you, afraid of what they might do, degraded and humiliated by the sexual acts, hurt by the hateful words they’re whispering in your ear, sore because he’s the fifth man you’ve had sex with today, exhausted from it all, traumatised, abused – the fact that you’ll get a bit of cash at the end does not change anything. There is no invisible hand in the prostitution market that magically disappears the lived experience of sexual abuse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7727b5699e103a8bcd7874591efc698088f88604\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7727b5699e103a8bcd7874591efc698088f88604/0_0_5000_3208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘The term “sex work” is a myth: the myth that it is possible to commodify consent.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The term “sex work” is a myth: the myth that it is possible to commodify consent.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Poverty can, of course, play a highly influential role in women’s entry into prostitution. However, bluntly asserting that poverty is the singular cause of the prostitution trade fails to acknowledge that men’s poverty has not begot a global demand from women to pay them for sex acts, that without men’s demand there would be no trade at all, or the highly specific abuses that so commonly characterise women’s entry into it.</p> <p>Research by the British Medical Journal found that, in three UK cities, half of women in outdoor prostitution, and a quarter of women in indoor prostitution, reported having been subject to violence by a sex buyer in the previous six months. Of the violence they had ever experienced at the hands of sex buyers, women on the streets most frequently reported being kicked, slapped or punched, while women in saunas or flats most frequently reported attempted rape (17% of women based indoors had experienced this, as had 28% of women on the streets). <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.ep10934742/abstract\">A separate study, in Sociology of Health and Illness</a>, involving more than 100 women engaged in flat-based prostitution in London, highlighted how an indoor setting can have its own particular coercive influence. Each day women had to pay up to £250 in rent, as well as up to £60 a day for a maid (who, in practice, often operated like a pimp, sometimes controlling which sex buyers the women saw), plus a range of other expenses. On average, a woman was paid for sex by 76 men each week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/mar/04/jeremy-corbyn-right-decriminalising-sex-industry-way-forward\">Jeremy Corbyn is right: decriminalising the sex industry is the way forward</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Economist’s 2014 article, titled <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21611063-internet-making-buying-and-selling-sex-easier-and-safer-governments-should-stop\">A personal choice</a>, warding off “puritans and do-gooders” from meddling with the sex trade, insists that governments should “leave consenting adults who wish to buy and sell sex to do so safely and privately online”. This builds on the claim that prostitution is sex work by attempting to frame that work simply as a series of individual, private exchanges set apart from the rest of society. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman\">Milton Friedman</a>, the late economist and proponent of unbridled free-market capitalism, implied much the same <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.chicagolife.net/content/other/An_Interview_with_Milton_Friedman\">when asked about prostitution in 2006</a>. “You put a willing buyer [with] a willing seller, and it’s up to them. You can argue with them that it’s foolish, you can argue with them that it’s a bad thing to do, but I don’t see any justification for bringing the police into it.” But the sex industry, like any market, doesn’t operate in a vacuum, leaving the rest of society miraculously untouched by its presence.

His story of a wooden puppet that dreams of being a real boy – and has a reputation for telling a few fibs – is imprinted in the soul of every Italian. Thanks to the work of Walt Disney in bringing Collodi’s story to the big screen, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/pinocchio-35.html\">Pinocchio</a> is also known around the world, and has entered every child’s fairy-tale universe.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bdc4d8166bd14c5f943e550572ff48901ea9e6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bdc4d8166bd14c5f943e550572ff48901ea9e6d/0_0_1272_1557/817.jpg\" alt=\"Pinocchio\" width=\"817\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everybody knows his name even if they don’t know how to spell it: Pinocchio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Axel Scheffler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I loved Collodi’s stories as a child, and I still love them now. Though he died in 1890, he is still Italy’s best and most popular children’s writer – even today. His style is unmistakable – a blend of everyday speech, inventiveness, playfulness and weirdness, with a lot of humour thrown in. It is very difficult to recreate that style in any other language – so much of what’s great about it gets lost in translation. That’s why rather than simply translating Collodi, I decided to reinvent and expand his delightful, lesser-known story of a mischievous pink monkey named Pipì. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jun/06/best-childrens-books-on-europe-katherine-rundell-ludwig-belman\">What are the best books to help children feel connected to Europe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Collodi wasn’t the most cheerful of writers, and even after the success of Pinocchio he hated being considered a children’s author. He saw himself as an Italian Dickens or Shakespeare, and wanted to write grand, important works for adults. He felt his talent was wasted as a children’s writer, despite the very obvious fact that he was so good at it. His frustration can clearly be seen as he published Pinocchio in instalments in his <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Giornale_per_i_bambini,_Pinocchio,_Collodi,_1882.jpg\">Giornale per i bambini </a><em>(</em>newspaper for children), since he tried to kill off the character many times in the most extraordinary ways! But Pinocchio<em>’s </em>success meant that Collodi couldn’t let him go, and he and the wooden boy were tied together for life. He was forced to continue to write about him in the Giornale and to create children’s stories throughout his life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce537662745d3633f4b9e8531bfb02f34c62b748\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce537662745d3633f4b9e8531bfb02f34c62b748/0_0_1772_1780/996.jpg\" alt=\"Pipì\" width=\"996\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pipì the pink monkey is in many ways very similar to Pinocchio, good at lying, disobedience and generally naughty.

He started to serialize the story but – much too the annoyance of his loyal readers – worked on it only in fits and starts, as it took his fancy. He published a few chapters in 1883, then there was a long break. He dragged on as he kept promising more, and concluded in a hasty, chaotic way only in 1885! The end result of all that struggle was <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/396982/\">The Adventures of Pipì the Pink Monkey</a>. Pipì’s tale, which was written straight after Pinocchio, shares many similarities with it. Incredibly, they also share some characters, including a 10-year-old boy named Alfred who was once a wooden puppet. Pipì himself is very similar to Pinocchio: both of them show a penchant for lying, disobedience and general naughtiness. Which is what makes their stories so fun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/may/30/record-the-stories-of-your-parents-gr-gemin-sweet-pizza\">Why you should record the stories of your parents or grandparents</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When translating and expanding Collodi’s original tale I’ve tried to rediscover its joyfulness and to find ways to replicate the original’s humour, which would otherwise have been lost in translation. I was delighted when I sent a draft to Axel Scheffler and he agreed to illustrate the book. Axel, who you may know as the illustrator of a certain scary monster named the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/gruffalo-8.html\">Gruffalo</a>, brought Pipì vibrantly to life. He added even more joyfulness to what is undoubtedly a rediscovered gem of Italian literature – which shows that, despite himself, Carlo Collodi was one of the best children’s writers of all time.</p>

What were their favourites? <em>Wolf Hall </em>was mentioned, of course, and so were books by Dorothy Dunnett and Mary Renault. Distracted, I began to draw up my own top five, a list which comprised, on that particular morning: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/24/simon-mawer-the-glass-room\" title=\"\"><em>The Glass Room </em></a>by Simon Mawer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2012/aug/20/pat-barker-regeneration-book-edinburgh-podcast\" title=\"\"><em>Regeneration</em></a> by Pat Barker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jun/18/book-club-possession-as-byatt\" title=\"\"><em>Possession</em></a> by AS Byatt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/02/fiction.sarahwaters\" title=\"\"><em>Fingersmith</em></a> by Sarah Waters and (would this be top?) <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/katherine-3.html\" title=\"\"><em>Katherine</em> by Anya Seton</a>.</p> <p><em>Katherine</em>, published in 1954 and never since out of print, tells the story of Katherine Swynford, the mistress and later the wife of John of Gaunt, the third son of Edward III. When we first meet her, this daughter of an obscure Flemish herald is straight from the convent, unformed and naive. However, her sister, who is betrothed to Geoffrey Chaucer, is a lady-in-waiting to the queen, and as a result, ​Katherine marries Sir Hugh Swynford, a Lincolnshire knight; only after his death do she and John, whose attention she first attracted at court, take up with one another, by which time her temples are streaked with white (“swan’s wings”, as John puts it).</p> <p>Seton, an American writing pre-Betty Friedan, doesn’t give Katherine the anachronistic feminist impulses so beloved of many current novelists – a relief to me. Nevertheless, her heroine, from whom the Tudor kings would ultimately descend, has her qualities, among them not only her loyalty and stoicism, but also a convincing eye for intrigue and how best it might be survived.</p> <p>I’ve no idea what I would have made of <em>Katherine</em> had I read it for the first time as an adult; I must have been about 13 when my father gave it to me, telling me I wouldn’t be able to put it down. But whenever I come back to it, older and supposedly more sophisticated, its castles, knights and wolfhounds still work their magic, for all that I see, now, Seton’s tendency to breathlessness.</p> <p>It’s one of those novels from which you emerge feeling slightly dopey, as if waking from a deep, dream-strewn sleep. Something about it invites both the suspension of disbelief and a girlish ardour that seems, in my case, to be extremely long-lasting.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4jjjc","wordcount":"381","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d6ea62773415e05ac6bd156bd9d8165bdaf7282/0_60_2634_1580/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-06-26T15:42:00Z","standfirst":"<p>I first read Katherine by Anya Seton when I was 13 – and it still works its magic on me</p>"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/07/katherine-anya-seton-shelf-life-rachel-cooke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/jun/07/katherine-anya-seton-shelf-life-rachel-cooke","sectionName":"Books","section":{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","editions":[{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","code":"default","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books"}],"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books"},"elements":[{"id":"3d6ea62773415e05ac6bd156bd9d8165bdaf7282","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d6ea62773415e05ac6bd156bd9d8165bdaf7282/0_60_2634_1580/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Time & Life Pictures","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/3d6ea62773415e05ac6bd156bd9d8165bdaf7282","suppliersReference":"00657653.jpg","altText":"Lady Nancy Astor (right) and Anya Seton (centre) with others at the American Penwomen’s Luncheon, May 1946.","caption":"Lady Nancy Astor (right) and Anya Seton (centre) with others at the American Penwomen’s Luncheon, May 1946.

rambling memoir","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Before John Lydon’s wild eyes alerted the world to punk, there were Wilko Johnson’s: two saucers on splints, sticking out of a handsome Easter Island head, on an angular body firing away on the guitar.</p> <p>Before punk’s gobby rush, there was also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Q9Zc7nZjw\" title=\"\">Johnson’s band</a> – four oddbods from Canvey Island called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/12/dr-feelgood-all-through-review\" title=\"\">Dr Feelgood</a>. Fired up by early rock’n’roll, their lyrical landscape was one of girls, drink and the estuary industry around which they grew up: real life with a rough kind of glamour, stripped down to brass tacks. The man behind the lyrics was a schoolteacher who’d studied old Icelandic at university. Johnson foreshadowed punk perfectly: it was always smarter than people thought.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johnson writes like the Mythical Bloke In The Pub speaks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He might have remained a cult character were it not for the incredible story of his last decade: a Julien Temple documentary on his old band (2009’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/31/oil-city-confidential-review-philip-french\" title=\"\"><em>Oil City Confidential</em></a>) spurring a new surge of interest, a notable bit part in HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em> (Sean Bean was “a gent”), then a diagnosis of terminal pancreatic cancer, leading him to do the final tour to end all final tours. In 2013, a fan (who was a surgeon) told him if the tumour hadn’t killed him yet maybe it wasn’t terminal. After further investigation, voila: Johnson was saved.</p> <p>This moving, rambling memoir (his first written alone; 2012’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/looking-back-at-me.html\" title=\"\"><em>Looking Back at Me</em> </a>was co-written by rock biographer Zoë Howe) is Johnson’s attempt to square the strangeness of that situation, to describe the thrill, in his experience, of knowing what it’s like to know the limits of your time, before those limits, along with your tumour, are suddenly taken away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/12/dr-feelgood-all-through-review\">Dr Feelgood… All Through the City (With Wilko 1974-1977) – review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson writes like the Mythical Bloke in the Pub speaks. Offering up a cracker of a tale, before going off on a tangent, he adds enough “anyways” and “sos” to make the more dramatic revelations relatable. When he describes the devastating Canvey Island floods of 1953 (“our house was in the sea”), his post-university jaunt to Kathmandu (“I had £60 stuffed down my Y-fronts”), and his post-Feelgood career as one of Ian Dury’s Blockheads (“somewhere along the way we picked up this character called Spartacus”), he does so without any descent into myth-making – a rare, attractive trait in rock’n’roll memoirs. “I wanted to present Dr Feelgood straight, simple and as it really was,” he writes of his group’s 1976 No 1 live album, <em>Stupidity</em>, at one point. This book brashly follows that lead.</p> <p>There’s a woman at the heart of this tale too: Johnson’s wife, Irene, who died in 2004. She’s the glue that holds this story together – the title an obvious nod to his grief – and she sounds a remarkable person, tolerating as she did her husband’s myriad indiscretions. Johnson and Lemmy had “trouble over a woman” in the mid-1970s, he says, in a fine section full of punk’s great and good, including John Lydon, but there’s no sign of any marital guilt. The section where Irene dies, however, is full of raw, affecting sentiment, especially when Johnson watches his sons “sat together under the trees… I wondered what they were feeling”. Here, he throws his hands up, showing all of his flaws.</p> <p>Sadness lifts from him during his illness, a time when Johnson felt “intensely alive”, and his humour also bubbles through, which is often wonderful. Take his reaction to being asked to present a lifetime achievement award to Elton John, who gave the award straight back to Johnson: “Well, these final months have certainly been packed with incident,” he quips. The final sections show a man not sure how to move on, but trying his best to find out. This book – rough, ready, distinctive, touching – surely helped.<strong> </strong></p> <p><em>Don’t You Leave Me Here is published by Little, Brown (£18.99). </em><a

It covers both meanings, because, as we know from history, when the great bards were performing their poetry it would be accompanied by music. The two were always intertwined and music, poetry, spoken word and performance have been a part of our society for centuries. The festivals called “eisteddfod” combine literature, music and poetry. These cultural competitions were not just for the rich or educated, but were held in pubs and other meeting places and brought everyone together. They are part of an oral tradition entrenched in Welsh society as it is in many other cultures, as diverse as the Somali tradition of oral storytelling or praise poetry in India and Pakistan.</p> <p>The Poet in the City festival of Poetry and Lyrics is another way of bringing people together and highlighting the idea that poetry and music are not, and have never really been, separate. The events will delve into the nooks and crannies of many different genres to draw out this connection and show how it lives in unexpected places. Take punk, for example: with the exception of artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/patti-smith\">Patti Smith</a>, it’s not usually associated with poetry. But Steve Lamacq, along with the Adverts’ TV Smith, Pauline Murray of Penetration and Crass’s Penny Rimbaud, will consider a less celebrated side of the movement: the lyrics about tenderness, love and social commentary that articulated a generation’s experience of the world. It is work that fits easily into a poetic tradition.</p> <p>Elsewhere we only have to go to children’s poetry and nursery rhymes for more evidence. The playfulness of poetic language makes much more sense to them and provides a highly imaginative means of connecting with the world – they don’t question it, and the music sticks with them. John Hegley will be exploring this in his PO-NG (poem-song) writing workshop for families.</p> <p>Another interesting angle is to ask what are the characteristics of those poems that entice composers to set them to music. So many classical musicians have adapted writers such as AE Housman or Walt Whitman, but composers of music from folk to soul have done the same.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/17/poetry-human-therapy-mental-health\">Poetry expresses what it is to be human – it’s therapy for the soul | Adam O’Riordan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Does it work so well the other way? Poems might function well as lyrics, but can lyrics be read as poetry? I suspect it’s harder. The structure of song and lyric can be quite specific to that song. Songs often rely on repetition. But however you view it, whether listening to song or poem, there is an endless fascination in the power of words, in the impact of a perfect turn of phrase. Take the work of the great lyricist Don Black, someone who sees the issue as black and white and for whom a lyric is a lyric and poetry is something else entirely. There is a line in his song “Born Free”: “Stay free, where no walls divide you”. I’ve heard it and read it so often. And every time it floors me.</p> <p>• Cerys Matthews is headlining at the inaugural Poetry &amp; Lyrics festival 2016, curated by Poet in the City at Kings Place, London N1, on 10 June. <a

Palace theatre in London tonight – and hardly needs critics’ star ratings to be a success<br>","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Many are already calling it the theatrical event of the decade. Tonight, the first part of <a href=\"http://www.harrypottertheplay.com/\">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a> has its first preview at the Palace theatre in London. Set 19 years after the end of JK Rowling’s last Potter novel, the two-part play continues the story of Harry who is now working at the Ministry of Magic while his son Albus negotiates his own way through Hogwarts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/05/jk-rowling-harry-potter-cursed-child-jack-thorne-john-tiffany-interview\">JK Rowling: ‘Harry Potter’s world is always in my head’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/16/hope-royal-court-jack-thorne-john-tiffany-interview\">John Tiffany</a> as director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/21/jack-thorne-interview-mark-lawson\">Jack Thorne</a> as writer and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jan/06/frantic-assembly-othello-scott-graham-steven-hoggett-interview\">Steven Hoggett</a> doing the movement, the play brings together the team behind the stage version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/08/let-right-one-in-review-apollo-theatre\">Let the Right One In</a>. That show’s combination of a magical otherworldliness and a spine-tingling exploration of very real teenage angst should be an admirable fit with Harry Potter.</p> <p>Back in 2007, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2007/02/the-hbr-list-breakthrough-ideas-for-2007\">Harvard Business Review</a> cited Harry Potter as a genius example of a product that matured with its customer base, thereby retaining them and ensuring that they keep buying through young adulthood and beyond. The only equivalent I can think of in theatre is Les Misérables, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/22/superfans-star-wars-madonna-harry-potter-les-miserables-andrea-bocelli\">stays the same but retains an audience</a>. People often get taken to Les Mis as a child, then they might see it again as a young adult and then take their own kids to see it, so generating that repeat business which is so essential to keep a show afloat in the West End.<br /></p> <p>The omens are good for the Cursed Child. The show is already almost entirely sold out for the foreseeable future, ticket prices are exorbitant on <a href=\"http://www.stubhub.co.uk/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-london-tickets/performer/1506472/?creative=87734858164&amp;keyword=142809345_c&amp;gcid=C12289B333\">secondary ticketing websites</a> and excitement from Potterheads is high. It won’t matter in the slightest what the critics say by the time they pronounce after the official opening on 30 July: social media will be giving the thumbs up or down this week, as audiences respond to the first previews.</p> <p>In the past we’ve seen shows such as <a href=\"https://westendwhingers.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/review-love-never-dies-adelphi-theatre/\">Love Never Dies</a> fall victim to early reaction on social media. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2013/mar/27/the-book-of-mormon-social-media-marketing\">Book of Mormon, however, very cleverly used social media</a> to generate a real buzz around the show – enthusiastic tweets from celebrities and others were used on the show’s advertisements, ensuring its juggernaut momentum before the first reviews were in. Book of Mormon swiftly became a hot ticket and its critical response became an irrelevance. </p> <p>In the case of Harry Potter, the Book of Mormon approach is hardly necessary because Potter fans will ensure that it generates its own momentum. Like the most devoted sports fans, they are true believers. It’s why they keep adding their own reviews on Amazon years after the book was originally released. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/22/society1\">Clay Shirky</a> has observed about these reviews, they may seem unnecessary, but what they reflect is a desire to go to the waterhole or town square and tell everyone how much you love something. Their function is not transactional, to help sell more books, but a means of amplifying your love for them.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6526b6fc8efc9da7199b0fd02cc098cd9a2adc65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6526b6fc8efc9da7199b0fd02cc098cd9a2adc65/343_412_639_383/500.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You only have to look at the 900-plus ratings that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has on the <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29056083-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child\">Goodreads website</a>, when so few people have actually seen the script, to see this phenomenon in action. In fact one of the most interesting aspects of The Cursed Child is that when it officially opens on 30 July, hundreds of thousands of people who have never been to the theatre or ever thought about reading a play will be devouring the story in playscript form.</p> <p>In the meantime, it seems that all involved in the stage show will have to muck things up pretty spectacularly for it to fail to please – and that’s unlikely, although I do wonder what it does to the creatives psychologically when they are working on a production in which they are keeper of the flame and also know that they’ve got a box-office hit on their hands before it has even begun. “I’m doing the best for them I can,” said Thorne about Potter fans. I’m sure he is, because it would be truly horrible if some of British theatre’s finest talent ended up being held responsible for ruining what many Potter fans believe represents childhood itself.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4kftp","wordcount":"697","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d6d2b44dfe45e812985b62492b70a2d9a07e5a0/0_175_3000_1800/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-06-14T08:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

I’ll have a read.”</p> <p>I went home and wrote a story, and it changed my life. I wrote about the young girl who was being beaten by her boyfriend. I wrote about the mother and daughter taking payday loans to reach the next payday, and then taking a payday loan to… Well, you get the picture.

Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","productionOffice":"US","trailText":"National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?</p>","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","productionOffice":"US","trailText":"Alex Malarkey co-wrote a bestselling book about a near-death experience – and then last week admitted he made it up.

high-quality, absorbing, easy-to-read African love stories set in cities as diverse as Lagos, Cape Town, and Jos and they’ve had African literary experts buzzing on Twitter for weeks.<br /></p>

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep.

freezes export of unique Erasmus manuscript by William Tyndale","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-14T15:30:07Z","fields":{"wordcount":"439","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","body":"<p>The export of a unique manuscript, a 16th-century translation of a work by the great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle","headline":"UK freezes export of unique Erasmus manuscript by William Tyndale","byline":"Maev Kennedy","commentable":"true","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","section":{"id":"culture","webTitle":"Culture","editions":[{"id":"culture","webTitle":"Culture","code":"default","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture"},{"id":"au/culture","webTitle":"Culture","code":"au","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/culture"},{"id":"uk/culture","webTitle":"Culture","code":"uk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/culture"},{"id":"us/culture","webTitle":"Culture","code":"us","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/culture"}],"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture"},"elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>Robert McCrum: </strong>Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict","headline":"The 100 best novels: No 68 – Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry (1947)","byline":"Robert McCrum","commentable":"true","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","section":{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","editions":[{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","code":"default","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books"}],"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books"},"elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

A tremendous work of history.</p> <p>Honorable mention: <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Lucky-Bastard-Tales-Tinseltown/dp/1493007971\">One Lucky Bastard: Tales from Tinseltown by Sir Roger Moore</a></strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Martin Pengelly, weekend editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinPengelly\">@MartinPengelly</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/books/review/alice-goffmans-on-the-run.html?_r=0\"><strong>On the Run by Alice Goffman</strong></a> is an unbelievably good ethnography about urban poor and their relationship with criminal justice in Philly that has become pertinent in light of Eric Garner/Michael Brown. </p> <p><em><strong>Paul Lewis, Washington correspondent (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulLewis\">@PaulLewis</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I was living in Australia for the first six months of the year and felt duty-bound to read <strong>Christos Tsiolkas</strong>’s latest book <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/03/barracuda-christos-tsiolkas-review\">Barracuda</a></strong>. I opened it expecting to hate-read it but immediately got pulled in. Angry, clever and compelling, it tells the story of Danny, the son of working class Greek immigrants whose talent as a swimmer puts him in a posh public school, with results as painful and inexorable as a belly flop from a diving board.</p> <p><em><strong>Alex Needham, arts editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexneedham74\">@alexneedham74</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I started reading <strong>Michael Azzerad</strong>’s <strong><a href=\"http://\">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a> </strong>in January, while listening to a load of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/oct/01/1\">Alistair Cooke’s Letter From America</a> that covered the same period. It was a great combination of amazing lucid storytelling from the world of underground rock and fairly straight-laced tales of Reagan’s presidency. The two somehow dovetailed together quite neatly especially when the Minutemen sang about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/20/usa.duncancampbell\">Iran-Contra</a> or Minor Threat reminisced about surviving on Reagan’s “government cheese”.</p> <p><em><strong>Lanre Bakare, commissioning editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanre_bakare\">@Lanre_Bakare</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>The best book I’ve read this year so far – and by far – was<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/one-summer-1927-bill-bryson-review\"> One Summer: America, 1927 by Bill Bryson</a></strong>. Come for the exhaustive research of this historical snapshot of a year in the life of America; stay for Bryson’s effortless wit and charm and his exquisite eye for fascinating detail.</p> <p><em><strong>Nicky Woolf, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickyWoolf\">@NickyWoolf</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Last year, around this time, I started reading a book about the internet – The Circle by Dave Eggers – on an iPad, which I lost on a plane, and then I tried to read it on my iPhone, and then Christmas was over, and so was my reading of the only book I read last year. This October, on vacation in Hawaii, I started reading a book about the beach – Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon – on a beach, before<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice\"> the movie</a> came out, and then my vacation was over and now the movie is out and here I am reading something else on my iPhone and there is that book over there, dog-eared to page 183 and dust-gathering forevermore. The best book I read this year was the only book I read this year, and I didn’t even finish it. The best thing we all read in 2014 was <strong>the internet</strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Matt Sullivan, comment editor (<a

<p>But new figures show that perhaps Britain is falling out of love with the celebrity memoir, with few of the genre making the top 10 chart despite new offerings from the comedy stalwarts Stephen Fry, John Cleese, Graham Norton and Paul Merton.</p> <p>Only the memoir of Lynda Bellingham, the “Oxo mum” and Loose Woman who died of cancer in October this year, has made it into the top five. Her book, Something I’ve Been Dying to Tell You, sold 37,118 copies, according to sales monitors Nielsen Book, making it to No 4 in the chart.</p> <p>The memoir of the British motorcycle racer Guy Martin – a hero of the Isle of Man TT races who has carved a television career often based on his engineering skills – is the only other celebrity title to make the top 10, selling 31,931 and securing ninth place.</p> <p>A report in the Bookseller magazine said sales of biographies and autobiographies had fallen by almost 4% this year. Earlier this month Charlie Redmayne, UK chief executive of HarperCollins, revealed he had cut back on buying up stars as non-fiction celebrity titles proved risky when publishers had to pay a big advance on a title that could turn out to be unprofitable with a short shelf life. “We’re moving away from big celebrity hit-and-miss stuff,” he said.</p> <p>“I felt the company had embraced some quite risky celebrity non-fiction. A lot of these books were hugely expensive and they were not necessarily going to backlist [continue to sell] well.”</p> <p>The other Christmas staple buy – the cookbook – has also fared less well this year. Although Jamie Oliver has topped the Christmas charts multiple times with previous offerings, this year’s outing, Jamie’s Comfort Food, proved less appetising to readers, with a Christmas week sale of 33,309 copies putting it in seventh place in the chart. Tom Kerridge’s Best Ever Dishes was 10th.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin at independent book chain Foyles said: “I think inevitably we can’t keep selling celebrity autobiographies and cookbooks, and big-name fiction, as the things we push every year. Eventually people are bored of it and look for something else. This has been a terrific year for books across the board.”</p> <p>This year’s bestseller is the Guinness World Records account of everything from how far a dog can ride a scooter to the world’s tallest man – still Robert Wadlow, who was measured at 272cm (8ft 11.1ins) in 1940 – with sales of 58,477 copies in the week to 20 December. It is the first time it has headed the Christmas charts since 2002.</p> <p>In second place – with a gap of more than 15,000 copies – came David Walliams’s Awful Auntie, with sales of 42,695. “Do you have an awful auntie?” Walliams opens his hit children’s story. “Perhaps your aunt demands you wear that horrendously itchy jumper she knitted for you at Christmas? The one which reads ‘I Love My Auntie’ in huge purple letters on the front? However awful your auntie might be, she will never be in the same league of awfulness as Aunt Alberta.”</p> <p>Jeff Kinney’s latest Wimpy Kid offering, The Long Haul, in which “middle-school weakling” Greg Heffley and his family take a road trip, came in a narrow third, with sales of 42,279 copies.</p> <p>“I think it has been a very strong year for young adult and kids’ fiction. And it’s a good signal that books remain an excellent Christmas gift,” said Nielsen’s Andre Breedt. “That’s the story of Guinness – it shows books are still an exciting Christmas present.”</p> <p>Zoe Sugg’s debut novel, Girl Online, takes the fifth-place slot. Sugg, who has more than five million subscribers on YouTube for her fashion and beauty video blogs, ran into some controversy earlier this month when it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/11/zoella-ghostwriter-sioban-curham-controversy-childrens-author\" title=\"\">her novel had been ghostwritten</a>, but the drama does not appear to have affected sales, with Girl Online – about a teenage blogger – selling 34,787 copies.</p> <p>Outside the top five, the top 10 is rounded out by Gillian Flynn’s thriller smash Gone Girl and Boris Johnson’s biography of Churchill.</p> <p>“The big surprise this Christmas has been Guy Martin. This is the bestselling autobiography of the year and has been the bestselling non-fiction title for Waterstones so far in December – an astonishing achievement for a title that is eight months old and from a figure who is not as widely known as some of the celebrities with books out this autumn,” said Richard Humphreys, Waterstones’ non-fiction buyer.</p> <p>Foyles’ top 10 ranged from astronaut Chris Hadfield’s You Are Here to Japanese novel The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, with just one memoir, neurosurgeon Henry Marsh’s Do No Harm, in the lineup.</p> <p>At Waterstones, the Private Eye Annual was the chain’s Christmas No 1, followed by Martin’s autobiography, Jessie Burton’s debut novel, The Miniaturist, and Girl Online.</p> <h2><strong>Nielsen book chart for Christmas week </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 </strong>Guinness World Records 2015 58,477</p> <p><strong>2 </strong>Awful Auntie, David Walliams 42,695</p> <p><strong>3 </strong>The Long Haul: Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Jeff Kinney 42,279</p> <p><strong>4 </strong>There’s Something I’ve Been Dying To Tell You, Lynda Bellingham 37,118</p> <p><strong>5 </strong>Girl Online, Zoe Sugg 34,787</p> <p><strong>6 </strong>Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn 34,222</p> <p><strong>7 </strong>Jamie’s Comfort Food, Jamie Oliver 33,309</p> <p><strong>8 </strong>Churchill Factor, Boris Johnson 32,625</p> <p><strong>9 </strong>Guy Martin: My Autobiography 31,931</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Best Ever Dishes, Tom Kerridge 26,481</p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"Publishers wary of signing well-known names for big money as sales stutter and Guinness World Records big seller again","headline":"Readers turn over new leaf as celebrity memoirs slip out of booksellers’ top 10","byline":"Alison Flood and Caroline Davies \r\n","commentable":"true","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-26T22:21:48Z","standfirst":"Publishers wary of signing well-known names for big money as sales stutter and Guinness World Records big seller again"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/23/readers-turn-over-new-leaf-celebrity-memoirs-slip-out-booksellers-top-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/23/readers-turn-over-new-leaf-celebrity-memoirs-slip-out-booksellers-top-10","sectionName":"Books","section":{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","editions":[{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","code":"default","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books"}],"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books"},"elements":[{"id":"9624f45ad9203a806bd322d4dc996862d4ea7537","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419373212944/Only-the-memoir-of-Oxo-mu-011.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*49095210","altText":"Only the memoir of 'Oxo mum' Lynda Bellingham and motorcycle racer Guy Martin have made it into the ","caption":"Only the memoir of ‘Oxo mum’ Lynda Bellingham and motorcycle racer Guy Martin have made it into the Nielsen Book top 10 this Christmas.

James remembered by Richard Coles","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-21T09:00:10Z","fields":{"wordcount":"514","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","body":"<p><strong>While studying for ordination at the College of the Resurrection in Yorkshire, the Reverend Richard Coles chaperoned the crime writer on one of her visits there.</strong></p> <p>“Call me Phyllis! While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>Richard Coles:</strong> the crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert to the gap between what was said and what was done","headline":"PD James remembered by Richard Coles","byline":"Richard Coles","commentable":"true","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00Z","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","section":{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","editions":[{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","code":"default","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books"}],"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books"},"elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Townsend remembered by Nicci Gerrard","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-21T09:00:10Z","fields":{"wordcount":"715","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4488n","body":"<p>Until I met Sue Townsend, I hadn’t realised it was possible to be hilarious, angry, scathing, sad, kind, self-mocking, solitary, gregarious and loveable all at the same time, in one breath gathering up a tumult of emotions and ideas. When she went blind, she talked to me about it with extraordinary humour (how she chatted to the coat hanging on the back of the door, mistaking it for her husband, Colin, threw gloves onto the compost heap instead of potato peelings, made a fine debut with her white stick) and yet managed to convey her loss and horror. Life had always bashed her about and she had always refused to be defeated by it. She was one of the most generous-hearted women I’d ever encountered, living life full-throttle, and yet somehow she remained mysterious, protecting her secret self, the self that wrote and dreamed.</p> <p>I visited her a couple of times in her Leicester home – a house crammed with objects, paintings on every wall, flowers in jugs, plants in pots, bowls and cups and knick-knacks and pieces of bric-a-brac everywhere, photographs of her family whose faces she could no longer see and messages she couldn’t read pinned onto the noticeboards, books she could no longer read on shelves and in piles on the floor. After she died, I went back to the house to talk to her family (I’m trained as a humanist celebrant and I conducted her funeral). It was very strange to be in her home – the house that Sue built – without her in it, sitting at the table, exuberant, life-filled, at the heart of things. The place was still full of objects (she was no minimalist) and full of people too, passionately bereft. Her husband, Colin, was there, and her four children and their partners, and also most of her grandchildren – her notion of family was broad and inclusive; home was always a place of welcome. They talked over each other, interrupted and added to each other, all wanting to share their versions of the many-sided Sue Townsend.</p> <p>She was the young girl who’d not learnt to read until eight and left her secondary modern at 15, but who’d devoured Russian, French and American literature and who was never without a book; the tree-climber (she would sit and read in the branches); the beatnik dressed in black; the single mother who had many jobs and no money but who made a feast out of Oxo cubes and tinned peas. She was the wife – Colin recalled their first meeting, when she’d seen him shepherding geese across the road and thought he was a nutter; their first date, when they’d taken her children skating; their holidays together. She was the grandmother, who never locked her door so that the grandchildren could come and go as they pleased and who let them dress up in her finest clothes and tear round the muddy garden. (Her boundless hospitality meant that sometimes there was no room for her and she had to book herself into the hotel down the road to get her books written.) She was the radical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/13/adrian-mole-sue-townsend-welfare\" title=\"\">who believed in social justice</a> and had 20 or so flying picket miners staying with them during the strike, who took her daughter to Greenham Common, who never let fame and fortune go to her head, who remained a woman of the people. She was the chain smoker, the world’s worst diabetic. The cafe-moocher, partygoer, late-nighter, mahjong player, vodka drinker, Chanel-No-5 and red-lipstick wearer (she would even put lipstick on to have a phone conversation), the beetroot and violet-cream devourer. She was the writer, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/11/adrian-moles-best-quotes-what-are-your-favourites\" title=\"\">Adrian Mole diaries </a>entered the national consciousness and who wrote about lives of quiet desperation and made them funny, even poetic. She was the dreamer.</p> <p>As her family shared their memories with me and with each other, as they talked, laughed and wept, what emerged was a woman whose generosity was almost reckless. And yet, in the midst of the warmth and chaos, Sue Townsend maintained her inviolable secret self – her writing self. And although she’s gone, although that house no longer has its centre, that self remains. Open any of her books and there she is: the unbeatable, unmistakeable, irreplaceable, unforgettable Sue.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>Nicci Gerrard</strong>, who conducted the
