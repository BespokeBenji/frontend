Apparently – get this – her favourite song is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbrnXl2gO_k\">Oklahoma!</a> from the musical Oklahoma!, followed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UB1YAsPD6U\">Anything You Can Do</a> from Annie Get Your Gun.</p> <p><strong>Nothing wrong with those. They’re classics.</strong> Well, I thought they were a bit Elaine Paige on Sunday, but whatever floats your boat. It gets worse, though. She also likes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEymZ3rXOmc\">Leaning on a Lamp-post</a> by George Formby.</p> <p><strong>Of course she does. She likes the music that was popular in her youth, just like everyone else in the world.</strong> I suppose that does make a small amount of sense. But, hey, get a load of this: she loves <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqtaoz4QFX8\">The White Cliffs of Dover</a> by Vera Lynn. What a crap song!</p> <p><strong>The woman lived during the second world war! The song probably reminds her of the unified national spirit during its darkest hour.</strong> I didn’t think of that. She loves Praise, My Soul, The King of Heaven and The Lord is my Shepherd, though. Bit bloody religious if you ask me.</p> <p><strong>She’s the head of the Church of England. She’s allowed to be religious.</strong> You’re making it really difficult for me to make fun of this, you know. There’s a regimental march in her top 10. What is she, some kind of warmonger?</p> <p><strong>For crying out loud, the woman is the commander-in-chief of the British armed forces. </strong>Right. OK. Sorry.</p> <p><strong>Is that all you’ve got? You’re berating a 90-year-old woman for liking music that both reflects her interests as a youngster and her duties as an adult? What’s wrong with you?</strong> Well, there is one more song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a7855817196ecd1ea215af708f59cc8d052d30a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a7855817196ecd1ea215af708f59cc8d052d30a/0_0_3545_3294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cool cats Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth boogie down to the sounds of the underground.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"929\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cool cats Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth boogie down to the sounds of the underground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What is it? </strong>Sing, by Gary Barlow.</p> <p><strong>Gary Barlow?

Ninis.</p> <p><strong>Nationality:</strong> Spanish.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Well rested.</p> <p><strong>What are they?</strong> They’re young people aged 18 and over who are neither studying nor working. Or “ni estudia ni trabaja”, as the phrase has it in Spanish, hence “ninis”.</p> <p><strong>I get it. What we would call </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/number-of-uk-neets-increases-for-second-consecutive-quarter\"><strong>Neets</strong></a><strong> then?</strong> That’s right. Or what some Italians call “bamboccioni” (“big stuffed babies”). And what their parents call “lazy freeloaders”.</p> <p><strong>Parents are so annoying. </strong>True. On the plus side, they also feed, clothe and house you for nothing.</p> <p><strong>I admit that is quite useful. Maybe they just pretend to be annoying so the children will move out? </strong>Could be. If so, the parents of some ninis in Girona and Pontevedra have found a way to be very convincing.</p> <p><strong>How’s that?</strong> Well, in Spain young people who aren’t working or studying are not entitled to benefits unless they have previously been in work for six months. Instead, their parents have been required to pay for their upkeep.</p> <p><strong>I see. </strong>You know how divorced couples often squabble over who gets custody of the children?</p> <p><strong>I am familiar with that sad situation from such films as Kramer vs. Kramer.</strong> Right. Well this is kind of the opposite of that, because now three divorced parents have just won appeals against the law. At last they have <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lazy-spanish-kids-k67czdbgk\">won the right to stop paying maintenance</a> and abandon their children to the local economy.</p> <p><strong>It’s tough love, I suppose. </strong>Less expensive love also. In one case, a father in Pontevedra was finally allowed to stop giving money to his 24-year-old son, who has <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lavanguardia.com%2Fvida%2F20160518%2F401875851546%2Fpadre-divorciado-se-libra-pagar-pension-hijo-nini-24-anos.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url\">worked a total of 40 days since leaving school</a> in 2009.</p> <p><strong>That’s not very much work, I admit. But is this fair? </strong><a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/\"><strong>Spain has the second-highest youth unemployment in the EU</strong></a><strong>, at 45.3%, which is more than triple the rate in Britain. Finding work isn’t easy. </strong>That’s true, and it is a serious problem. It’s just that in this case the judge said that the young man’s failure to show “the proper application or dedication [to] studies or finding an occupation” might also have something to do with.</p> <p><strong>Judges are annoying, too.</strong> So it would seem.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “You treat this place like a hotel!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “I’d like an alarm call at 2pm, and the continental breakfast.”</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61f37878b5640e03d2eb02ece18e9ba8733d6e07\"> <img

I’m an English literature student, I know waffling when I see it.”</p> <p><strong>So she’s saying that instead of answering the question, Cameron stamped little squares into it using an iron or similar implement?</strong> No. She was either accusing him of talking nonsense, or of deliberately wandering off the point in a tiresome bid to avoid answering.</p> <p><strong>Come, come – which is it?</strong> Most likely she meant it in the latter sense, although “to waffle” can also mean to be indecisive, ie to flip-flop.</p> <p><strong>I can’t keep up.

Was the PM waffling?</strong> It depends on who you ask. On the one hand, many viewers felt Cameron deserved to be upbraided for his evasiveness. But lots of others thought Bouazzaoui rude and a bit of a waffler herself.</p> <p><strong>What did you think?</strong> Me? Well, I think it’s obviously important to strike a balance with these things. And also to keep a bit of perspective.

Aimed at students. Pheasant with a walking stick for a logo. Quite posh.</p> <p><strong>And that’s sexy? </strong>Well, no, the brand isn’t sexy. The brand sells expensive hoodies and overpriced polo shirts. It sells a boating blazer so obnoxious that it must exist only to help identify people who want to be punched. Jack Wills isn’t sexy.</p> <p><strong>Then what is? </strong>A recent Jack Wills mailout catalogue. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/01/jack-wills-underwear-party-ad-catalogue-banned\">so sexy it ended up banned</a>.</p> <p><strong>What’s so sexy about it?</strong> It contains images of several attractive teenagers standing around in their pants, having fun.</p> <p><strong>I hate stupid sexy fun.</strong> Me too. Imagine seeing a catalogue like that as a kid and realising that you would one day be expected to stand around in your pants with your friends in an annoyingly louche manner. It would ruin your life.</p> <p><strong>Oh God, were these catalogues addressed to children? That’s appalling. </strong>Well, no. They were actually addressed to adults. But one of the adults was a parent, and that parent had kids who might feasibly have seen the catalogue, so they complained. Does that count?</p> <p><strong>I don’t think so. </strong>Well, <a href=\"https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2016/6/Jack-Wills-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_331708.aspx#.V06jcjYrKhc\">the Advertising Standards Authority said it did</a>. Its statement read: “The images in question showed [teenagers] relaxing and engaging in activities such as dancing, drinking and reading a newspaper together.”</p> <p><strong>Teenagers reading a newspaper? What an obscene fantasy! </strong>The ASA goes on: “Moreover, we noted that the story of the group of friends depicted them dancing and drinking while fully clothed, then dancing and drinking in their underwear … and a final scene of all of the characters in their underwear in bed together. We considered that this sequence of images … was sexually suggestive.”</p> <p><strong>And so it has been banned?</strong> Absolutely. Presumably, all future Jack Wills catalogues will feature normal teenage activities, such as being spotty and playing Xbox and having bad hair.</p> <p><strong>But where will kids find pictures of nudity now? </strong>Nowhere. The images were only available in that one Jack Wills catalogue, and now it has been banned. Our kids are safe again! Thanks, ASA!</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Jack Wills: Fabulously British.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Jack Wills: Perverted Newspaper-promoting Fetishists.”</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7635a9ff36b538b823105349dcabb2956b5fdb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7635a9ff36b538b823105349dcabb2956b5fdb9/135_938_1154_692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banned Jack Wills advert\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just look at them, hanging out and digesting current affairs. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ASA/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4k36n","wordcount":"376","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7635a9ff36b538b823105349dcabb2956b5fdb9/135_938_1154_692/500.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"574ed21ee4b0467e825fb9f2","newspaperPageNumber":"3","commentCloseDate":"2016-06-04T12:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>A recent catalogue for the student-friendly clothing brand featured attractive young things reading in their pants.

I know they had a big win, but that’s a tenuous link to glory. </strong>No, Chapman is a postman who looks like Jamie Vardy. He is also a diehard Leicester City fan and came to minor prominence when the team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/jamie-vardy-lookalike-leicester-city-bus\" title=\"\">hauled him on to the victory bus</a> to celebrate with his beloved Foxes in the wake of their Premier League triumph.</p> <p><strong>That’s nice. </strong>Yes, it was.</p> <p><strong>Is it not still? </strong>It was nice for a while. A lookalike agency spotted the photos the team posted from the bus and offered Chapman work. The Royal Mail <a href=\"http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Jamie-Vardy-s-lookalike-given-time-pursue-new/story-29264541-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">has given him six months off to pursue the opportunity</a>.</p> <p><strong>That is REALLY nice!</strong> He’s got a verified Twitter account with more than 3,500 followers, where he offers fans the chance to make video messages with him and posts pictures of himself in full Leicester kit with them at events. Rumours swirl about a Celebrity Big Brother appearance and UK comedy tour with other lookalikes.</p> <p><strong>Sound, hopefully lucrative, moves. </strong>But Chapman says that Vardy – and his new wife, Rebekah Nicholson, have blocked him on Twitter and Instagram.</p> <p><strong>What?! No?! Why? </strong>Vardy’s agent reportedly <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/7185403/Jamie-Vardy-blocks-postie-lookalike-on-social-media-as-England-striker-looks-to-protect-his-image.html?CMP=spklr-_-Editorial-_-TWITTER-_-TheSunFootball-_-20160531-_-Football-_-479896598-_-Imageandlink\" title=\"\">sent Chapman a text message warning</a> him not to do anything that would put any of Vardy’s endorsement deals at risk.</p> <p><strong>I see. A rogue lookalike could taint the brand.</strong> Exactly.</p> <p><strong>Could it though, really? </strong>I don’t know. Vardy and his manager seem to think so.</p> <p><strong>Would a superfan since childhood really do that? </strong>You can’t be too careful.</p> <p><strong>You probably can, though. I could see a backlash forming against high-handed behaviour from footballer-suddenly-shot-to-fame to fan-who-supported-him-through-all-the-lows-as-well-as-highs. </strong>There might be one starting already actually.</p> <p><strong>Oh?</strong> Yes, a hashtag is already doing the rounds: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mardyvardy?src=hash\" title=\"\">#mardyVardy</a></p> <p><strong>I like it.

Or that fish from <em>those films</em>, to be exact. Because Dory, the loveably forgetful Pacific regal blue tang in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/finding-nemo\">Finding Nemo</a>, is now the central character of a forthcoming sequel, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2277860/\">Finding Dory</a>.</p> <p><strong>This is very exciting. Finding Nemo was great! </strong>Yes, and in fact quite a lot of people are super-extra-excited by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKJA-VLpiCo&amp;feature=player_embedded\">the trailer</a>, because <a href=\" http://www.thewrap.com/finding-dory-lesbians-first-pixar-disney-gay-characters-ellen-degeneres/\">they think it shows a gay couple</a>, which would be a first for Disney or Pixar film.</p> <p><strong>Why do they think this? </strong>There’s an extremely brief shot of two women returning a bottle to an octopus in a buggy. One of the women has fairly short hair.</p> <p><strong>Um…</strong> <strong>Is that conclusive?</strong> No. But it would be a big deal if it was conclusive because usually gay characters are gay only codedly, like it’s something to be ashamed of.</p> <p><strong>I see. Like the seven dwarfs? </strong>I don’t think they were codedly gay in fact. Anyway, the big moment will come when it’s no big deal.</p> <p><strong>Unlike now? </strong>Yes.<strong> </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"613d959a2b0ed86932ea8e62db46fc4b3d0eca75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/613d959a2b0ed86932ea8e62db46fc4b3d0eca75/150_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dory, the forgetful fish, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dory, the forgetful fish, voiced by Ellen Degeneres.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>But if no one’s seen the film yet, how do we know that the women are clearly gay? Maybe they’re just friends? Maybe they’re on their way to an anti-gay rally?</strong> Yes, there is quite a lot we don’t know about these probably fleeting and, in any case, fictional characters. Although it would make a kind of sense them being gay, since <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/03/25/175265720/how-ellen-degeneres-helped-change-the-conversation-about-gays\">Degeneres herself played such a big role in the gay rights story</a>.</p> <p><strong>I suppose.</strong> And the excitement about it is a sign of the hunger out there to continue gay people’s journey into the mainstream by including them in kids’ films. Hence the campaign to #<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/03/frozen-fans-urge-disney-to-give-elsa-girlfriend-lgbt\">GiveElsaAGirlfriend</a> in the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen\">Frozen</a> movie, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/idina-menzel\">Idina Menzel</a>, who played Elsa, now supports.</p> <p><strong>Blimey. What if the writers agree, but want to choose their own political statements? Or make none at all?</strong> Not making a political statement is itself a political statement.</p> <p><strong>Even in a film about fish?</strong> You’re being icthyonormative again.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Wait, wasn’t <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTrIsk_d7_8\">Ken in Toy Story 3</a> gay?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “He’s more of a mixture of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkg2ptFFTD4\">bisexual and homophobic</a>.”</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88f64b8af760a2a69c36dac7b225cb0413fded7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88f64b8af760a2a69c36dac7b225cb0413fded7a/6_0_2208_1325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Are they gay?

If somebody wants to join, well, you’d better get married to somebody who’s a member.”</p> <p><strong>Oh.</strong> “All of the wives of members at these clubs could have used the facilities for free. When I was at Muirfield a couple of years ago, talking to a few of the lady members, I said: ‘What about this equality? You must be happy about that?’ ‘God no,’ they said.”</p> <p><strong>Oh God.</strong> Last year, the BBC had to apologise because, as Zach Johnson was about to win the Open, Alliss said of his wife: “She is probably thinking, ‘If this goes in, I get a new kitchen.’”</p> <p><strong>OK, he’s a man out of time.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSNAtNKobfI\">Once he said, apropos of nothing</a>: “Carol Vorderman.
